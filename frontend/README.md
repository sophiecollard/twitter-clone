# Twitter clone frontend

Simple Twitter clone to demo building single-page frontend applications with [Elm 0.19](https://elm-lang.org/) and [elm-spa](https://elm-spa.dev).

## Requirements

Ensure the following software is installed:
  * [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  * [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)
  * [elm-spa](https://elm-spa.dev)

All commands below assume `elm-spa` has been installed globally, using:

```bash
npm install --location=global elm elm-spa
```

## Usage

```bash
elm-spa server  # starts this app at http:/localhost:1234
elm-spa add    # add a new page to the application
elm-spa build  # production build
elm-spa watch  # runs build as you code (without the server)
```
